# Amazon Athena

`Amazon Athena` is defined as “an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyse data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL.” 

So, it’s another SQL query engine for large data sets stored in S3. 
This is very similar to other SQL query engines, such as Apache Drill. 

But unlike `Apache Drill`, Athena is limited to data only from Amazon’s own S3 storage service. However, Athena is able to query a variety of file formats, including, but not limited to `CSV`, `Parquet`, `JSON`, etc.
